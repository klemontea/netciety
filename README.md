# Welcome to Netciety
A social media website for people to connect and share their lives

## Introduction
This is my first website project which uses three layers architecture (front-end, back-end, and database) and part of my portfolios. The website is called Netciety, a social media website like facebook, twitter, etc. I tried to create this website to be like but not similar to them. Through this website, users can interact with their friends by posting or sharing their lives in form of text or photo.
The features that you can do in this website for now are as follows:
- Search friend
- Add and Unfriend friend
- Post text and upload picture
- Send and read message
- Comment and like system
- Change profile picture
- Gallery

## Technology Involved
All technologies involved in the creation of this website are as follows:
- Bootstrap
- PHP
- SQL

## How to Use
I don't host my website online. Therefore, you need a software that acts like a server (XAMPP, MAMP, etc.). Because I use XAMPP when developing this website, I will explain how to use it in order to make the website work. /n
- Download and install XAMPP on your computer
- Navigate to htdocs folder
- Inside this folder, create a folder called 'netciety' (all lowercase)
- Download and put all files and folders in this repository into 'netciety' folder
- Open Phpmyadmin in your localhost
- Import 'netciety.sql' file into Phpmyadmin
