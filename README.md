# Welcome to Netciety
A social media website for people to connect and share their lives

## Introduction
Hello everyone, wherever you are! This is my first website project which uses three layers architecture (front-end, back-end, and database). The topic is about social media website like facebook, twitter, etc. and I want to create one like but not similar to them. Through this website, users can interact with their friends by posting or sharing their lives in form of text or photo. 

## Technology Involved
All technologies involved in the creation of this website are as follows:
- Bootstrap
- PHP
- SQL

## How to Use
I don't host my website online, and so you need software that use your PC as a server like XAMPP, MAMP, etc. Because I use XAMPP when developing this website, I will explain how to use it in order to make the website work. /n
- Download and install XAMPP on your computer
- Navigate to htdocs folder
- Inside this folder, create a folder called 'netciety' (all lowercase)
- Download and put all files and folders in this repository into 'netciety' folder
- Open Phpmyadmin in your localhost
- Import 'member.sql' file into Phpmyadmin
